# PRACTICAL ASSIGNMENT 04: INTRODUCTION TO PANDAS AND NUMPY

## NUMPY

A NumPy array is a data structure that is designed to efficiently handle operations on large data sets. These data sets can be of varying dimensions and can contain numerous data typesâ€”though not in the same object. NumPy arrays are used as input and output to many other libraries and are used as the underpinning of other data structures that are important to data science.

Please solve the exercises provided in the notebook: exercise_numpy.ipynb


## PANDAS

he Pandas DataFrame, which is built on top of the NumPy array, is probably the most commonly used data structure. DataFrames are like supercharged spreadsheets in code. They are one of the primary tools used in data science. This exercise looks at creating DataFrames, manipulating DataFrames, accessing data in DataFrames, and manipulating that data
